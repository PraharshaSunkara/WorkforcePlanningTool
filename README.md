SETTING UP AWS TO WORK WITH CODE:



FUTURE IMPROVEMENTS:
- Fix plan view so that it displays the sums of counts per plan page
- Due to time constraints security is lacking, especially with how users are stored / managed
- Copy and pasting from plans
- Things in accounts.js may be redundant when downloading the user file
- End user testing would help iron out remaining bugs and issues
- Logging would be very easy to implement: the user name is already stored, just need to log the time whenever a plan is edited
